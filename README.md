In this project I:
* Made A/B test design decisions on Udacity to decide whether or not to add a pop-out screener;
* Selected appropriate invariant metrics and evaluation metrics;
* Conducted sanity check, effect size test, and sign test.
* Analyzed the results and recommended whether or not to launch the change.
